# How Hybrid Work Has Affected ERP Rollouts

Hybrid work is no longer an experiment; it is the mainstream operating paradigm for the modern enterprise. This shift hasn't simply tweaked plans — it has changed the fundamentals of ERP rollouts. The old playbook (“bring everyone into training rooms and cutover together”) is now risky and obsolete.

The challenge is more than technology: governance, user experience, and the human ways people organise work have all changed. To succeed, treat three practical blind spots as first-class design concerns from day one.

---

## 1) Seamless access — more than “put it in the cloud”

Moving core systems to the cloud is necessary but not sufficient.

**Problem (example):** A regional distributor’s warehouse scanning app relied on local file shares. After cloud migration, the scan workflows failed and staff reverted to manual logs.

**Fixes**
- **API-first design:** Replace brittle file-based flows with small transactional REST / OData endpoints.
- **Role-based UX:** Use Fiori launchpad tiles to reduce cognitive load and bandwidth.
- **Offline-first mode:** Queue writes on devices and sync idempotently when online.

**Pro tip:** Test remote-user scenarios on real home Wi-Fi and low-bandwidth networks.

## 2) Embed collaboration inside ERP (don’t let context live in email)

When collaboration happens outside the ERP, audit trails and “why” disappear.

**Problem (example):** Finance teams resolve invoice exceptions in email while SAP holds the ledger, creating context loss and repeated follow-ups.

**Fixes**
- **Embed discussion threads** (Teams/Slack) directly into SAP work items.
- **Auto-capture decision traces** back into the ERP record.
- **Micro-workflow escalation** if threads remain unresolved beyond SLAs.

**Pro tip:** Prefer small, auditable integrations to heavyweight sync jobs.

## 3) Training as rhythm, not a single event

Users want help at the moment of need, not a two-hour generic session.

**Better approach**
- **Micro-learning:** 45–90 second videos tied to specific Fiori tiles or tasks.
- **Cohort runbook rehearsals:** Real teams practice real transactions end-to-end.
- **Virtual office hours:** Short function-based expert sessions for the first weeks post-go-live.

**Pro tip:** Build learning content around the top 3 most-used, most-problematic tasks per function.

## How that changes delivery

Adopt hybrid-first design as a delivery pillar alongside data quality and security:
- Include remote scenarios in *definition of done*.
- Make collaboration trace mandatory in exception workflows.
- Treat training as ongoing operations, not a checkbox.

Small, focused improvements in access, collaboration, and training reduce post-go-live firefighting and protect process integrity.

## Conclusion

Hybrid work is the operating norm. ERP rollouts that design for resilient access, embedded collaboration, and moment-of-need training will win adoption and cut rework. Start by fixing one cross-boundary process (remote + office users), validate the pattern, then scale.
